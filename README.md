## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

This project demonstrates a complete data cleaning pipeline using SQL (MySQL) on a real-world layoffs dataset. The dataset included inconsistencies, missing values, formatting issues, and duplicate rows. The goal was to transform it into an analysis-ready state suitable for dashboards, reporting, and deeper analysis.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- SQL (MySQL)
- Excel

## ðŸ§¾ Overview

The original dataset was messy and required extensive cleaning:
- Duplicate rows with no unique identifier
- Inconsistent industry and country values
- Trailing spaces and characters in text fields
- Improper date format stored as text
- Missing values in important fields

---

## âœ… Key Cleaning Steps

1. **Removed Duplicates**
   - Used `ROW_NUMBER()` with `PARTITION BY` to identify exact duplicate rows.
   - Retained only the first instance (`row_num = 1`) and deleted the rest.

2. **Standardized Text Fields**
   - Applied `TRIM()` to remove extra spaces.
   - Standardized categories (e.g., `Crypto` â†’ `Cryptocurrency`).
   - Cleaned country names (`United States.` â†’ `United States`).

3. **Handled Missing Values**
   - Deleted rows where both `total_laid_off` and `percentage_laid_off` were NULL.
   - Filled missing `industry` values using a `SELF JOIN` based on company name.

4. **Fixed Date Formatting**
   - Converted date strings (MM/DD/YYYY) to proper `DATE` format using `STR_TO_DATE()`.
   - Altered the column type from `TEXT` to `DATE`.

5. **Final Touches**
   - Dropped intermediate columns like `row_num`.
   - Verified structure and integrity of final dataset.

## ðŸ“ˆ Outcome

The cleaned dataset is ready for:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Business dashboards (e.g., Power BI, Tableau)
- Reporting & time-series trend analysis
